LED control using AJAX
----------------------

Control the default LED(on GPIO2) on the ESP12E using webpage.

With AJAX the page is dynamic i.e each time you press the Toggle button on the webpage,
the page is not loaded. Only the info to toggle the LED is sent to ESP12E and the ESP12E reponds
with the current status(On/Off) of the LED.This is much memory effiective otherwise, the whole 
webpage needs to be loaded which need more time.

Steps to use this example
-------------------------

1) Upload the LED_AJAX.ino file and also the contents of the data folder to 
the flash using Tools -> ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload

2) Connect to the WiFi network "LED Control"

3) On your browser(on laptop or phone) open any domain name(example: test.mn). This should open the webpage.
Press the toggle button to toggle the LED.
